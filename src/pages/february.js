              The Emeka Anyimude Initiative visited NDIULO NGBO GJSS, where the
              organization donated study materials to the students of the
              school. The materials ranged from pencils, textbooks, to notebooks.
              This was done in an effort to support less privileged students in
              public schools across Ebonyi State. Our donations align with the
              findings of our survey regarding student performance in the
              school, which revealed that many students face challenges due to a
              lack of study materials.
